# For later refernce, this is th order in which the properties from OCELOT appear


The DFT and TDDFT properties available in the dataset are 
vertical (VIE) and adiabatic (AIE) ionization energies, 
vertical (VEA) and adiabatic (AEA) electron affinities, 
cation (CR) and anion (AR) relaxation energies, 
HOMO energies (HOMO), 
LUMO energies (LUMO), 
HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (H–L), 
electron (ER) and hole (HR) reorganization energies, and 
 singlet (S0S1) and triplet (S0T1) excitation energies
