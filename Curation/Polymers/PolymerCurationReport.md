# Data collection on polymers 

## CROW Database:

This is a knowledgbase on polymersciecne and polymer engineering overall. It contains properties and polymer categories for (**number of polymers that I find**). Data was connected though the use of a web scraper, which can be found in the /PolymerDataCollection/CROW/ folder.

Unfortunately, as of 2024 This database is now defunct. We were lucky to capture it during our data curation process.

## Data from the publication "Machine-learning-assisted discovery of polymers with highthermal conductivity using a molecular design algorithm"

Data can be found on the associated github https://github.com/stewu5/HighTCond_Polymer_iqspr.git

Paper can be found at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-019-0203-2, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-019-0203-2

This paper contains 38,310 polymeric structure-property associations, as well as polymeric structures. The properties included are:
- Thermal Conductivity 
- glass transition tempertaure
- Melting temperature 
- Density

Much of this information comes from the PolyInfo Database.

## Khazana
Contains 6233 datapoints on computed perperties of polymers such as atomization energy (eV/atom),crystallization tendency (%), band gap chain (eV), band gap bulk (eV), electron affinity (eV), and others.


The data in this project was collected from **Polymer informatics with multi-task learning**, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8085610/, 10.1016/j.patter.2021.100238
