When two vinegar fiber dyed with polyester similar color shade, the dyeing speed slow. Good levelness, but dye deep the gender is poorer. Three vinegar is dyed fiber dyed deep sex is better. Dyeing nylon is blue color, the dyeing speed is slow, levelness and dye deep sex medium. So when a black silk ribbon with colored light blue, the dyeing rate is low, soaping fastness is bad two this product can be used for nylon polyester fabric or the direct printing, be not white color, suitable for transfer printing. To calcium, iron ion is very sensitive, dye bath these ions are colored light slant blue:"
